\section{Running {\it DINO}}
\label{Running}
After the code is compiled, specific applications (in subdirectories) can be generated by the users in the \$DINOSOARS\_RUNS directory. The corresponding input file DINO\_IN should be in the same subdirectory. To launch the calculation, \textit{cd} to that directory, and run the execute file \textit{DINOSOARS\_V0.0.0.e}. The execute file will use DINO\_IN in the current directory as the default input file. To run in parallel, type
\begin{lstlisting}
$ mpirun -np {Number of processors} DINOSOARS_V0.0.0.e
\end{lstlisting}
when using intel compiler, type
\begin{lstlisting}
$ export MP_NODES = {Number of nodes};
$ export MP_PROCS = {Number of processors};
$ poe DINOSOARS_V0.0.0.e
\end{lstlisting}
when using ibm compiler.
If the case is to be run on supercomputer or cluster, a job command file can be created and used, depending on the server/machine where the simulation is to be performed. For more information about these scripts, the user should contact his/her institute/company/HPC help desk.
